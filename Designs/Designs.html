            <p>Welcome to the design section. You can find all my design iterations down below.</p>

            <h3>First Iteration Wireframes</h3>

            <p> These first iterations of my wireframes were made with the intention of being optimised for both laptops
                and cellular devices. They are not the final designs layouts for my wireframes. I still intend to update
                these designs, especially for when we begin to add CSS to our websites. I plan to have my text to the
                left hand side of the pages, creating a familiar reading experience for the user. I plan to use a
                readable font that does not make the user uncomfortable. The layout will have spave so the user feels
                free when exploring the page.</p>

            <h3>User Flow and Information structure</h3>

            <p> These diagrams are meant to represent my user flow and information structure. When the user opens my
                website, they are lead to the hompage which allows them to acces the other pages of my website. More
                features will be added to the hompage as I continue working on my website. When exploring each
                individual page, there will be a navigation bar leading back to the homepage and all the other pages,
                allowing simple access to everthing available on my website.</p>
            <p> My blogs page will be up to date with the weekly blogs we have been assigned, the user will be able to
                read my notes on the course so far. Similar to the blogs page, the design and essay pages will work the
                same way in terms of navigation and function.</p>
            <p> My profile page will contain general information about myself as the site developer. The protfolio page
                will be filled with things I have done over the semester in my other courses. </p>

            <h3>Style Guide: Second Design Iterations:</h3>

            <p>These are the new iterations of my page layout and colour schemes. I tried to focus on a colour scheme
                that would be easy on the viewers eye, as well as the use of shapes that users are familiar with. Some
                things I would critique about my style guides is firstly the spacing. I noticed that there is no space
                between the profile image and the site content, making the site feel claustrophobic. The second thing I
                would critique is the font to colour matching, the font disappears into the background. These are issues
                that I will address as I continue working on my website.</p>

            <h3>Style Guide: Final Design Iterations</h3>

            <p> This image is an example of how I plan to style the rest of my website. I tried to keep the same colour
                scheme from my previous iteration and made a few UI placement changes.</p>
