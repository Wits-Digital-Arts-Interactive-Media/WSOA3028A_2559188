            <h2>Digital Colonialism: What Does that mean for SA software developers?</h2>

            <p>
                The 2019 article that covered Sareeta Amrute’s keynote speech titled "Tech Colonialism Today” offers
                detailed and enlightening practices in the tech industry and how they replicate colonial relationships
                and behaviours. Such behaviours and relationships include hierarchical structures, exploitative labour,
                and extractive practices, leading to uneven consequences and malevolent paternalism. These observations
                highlighted by Amrute provide us with a clear framework for examining the recent retrenchment of Google
                workers, and the broader implications of that in a South African context regarding our local developers.
                In this essay I will be exploring these dynamics while relating to both the global and local software
                development industry and how we can aim to decolonize technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                In her keynote speech, Amrute speaks on colonial practices that are currently present within the tech
                industry. By her definition, colonialism is “a historical relationship by which Europe expanded its
                borders of control, fought wars by proxy, drained the wealth of other territories, established an
                often-violent system of rule to govern those territories’ populations, instituted a global pattern of
                slavery and indentured servitude, and developed a rule of law that applied fully only to Europeans
                themselves, but was taken up by the rest of the world as a mandate for full human rights” (Amrute, 2019
                pg. 2). Based on this definition, she goes further by describing colonial relationships as hierarchical,
                extractive, and exploitative, which lead to uneven consequences and paternalism on those who are
                colonized.
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on this, we can first acknowledge that this has been the case for most countries within the Global
                South for centuries, especially South Africa. Secondly, we can identify that certain colonial practices
                are being perpetuated within the tech industry today through Amrute's relationship. Google’s decision to
                retrench hundreds of their workers in May this year while shifting those empty positions to India and
                Mexico may sound good on paper, but this only serves to reflect several aspects of Amrute’s points on
                digital colonialism.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first of these aspects is the hierarchical structures, where power and decision-making are
                centralized within the Global North, marginalizing those in the Global South. Google’s decision to move
                their jobs to India and Mexico not only reflects an exploitative approach in employing labour but also
                perpetuates a form of economic dependency and subordination. A previous reading I had done titled
                “Decolonizing the Machine: Race, Gender, and Disability in Robots and Algorithmic Art: Abramovic et al.”
                speaks on the reproduction of existing power dynamics within the art space and how it has filtered into
                the tech industry and as a result has marginalized certain groups based on race, gender, and
                disabilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                What stood out for me the most about this reading was how it addressed the very thing that was happening
                in Google, “…the field of computer science and popular ideas about technology and the future have
                hitherto centred around a small and largely homogenous group of people” (Broussard, 2018). Amrute
                mentions a similar statement by the same data journalist Meredith Broussard who further describes this
                as techno-chauvinism. Broussard defines techno-chauvinism as “the belief of a small group of fairly
                homogenous people located primarily in Silicon Valley that are the best people to deploy a small set of
                algorithmic applications to administer human life” (Broussard, 2018). Based on these two statements,
                what this tells us is that a “white male, privileged and ignorant” group of board members is making
                decisions without consulting those it aims to “help” and is blatantly being ignorant by assuming jobs
                will help those in Mexico or India, thereby exploiting those who are vulnerable enough to take those
                positions and perpetuating the colonial cycle in which Amrute speaks about.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, the extraction of labour from these regions further proves the perpetuation of these
                colonial practices, in that workers from India and Mexico are being exploited as cheap labour without
                adequate pay. These employees are not only seen as a means of cutting costs to Google but also serve as
                a means of collecting so-called, “raw data” from an “untapped market.” This relationship benefits no one
                in these Global South regions as it is an unfair, unbalanced exchange of materials, like the
                relationship between former colonies and their colonizers. Not only that but nowhere in this CNBC
                article does it mention how the native people of these regions will benefit from this employment, it
                only serves to paint Google's initial retrenchment in a better light by creating the impression that it
                will help. Another reading I came across in my research titled “Algorithmic Colonization of Africa” by
                Abeba Birhane contains a chapter that highlights how big tech companies use tactics like the one Google
                is doing.
            </p>

            <p>
                In her chapter titled “Data are People,” Birhane states that “This muting of the individual, a person
                with fears, emotions, dreams, and hopes, is symptomatic of how little attention is given to matters such
                as people’s well-being and consent, which should be the primary concerns if the goal is indeed to ‘help’
                those in need,” (Birhane, 2020). There was no consultation done by CNBC or Google that genuinely asked
                the people of Bangalore or Mexico City how they felt about the increase in job opportunities and how it
                benefits them. But one thing is clear, it is very evident that it is also a way for Google to mine
                people’s data.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of this ultimately leads to what Amrute describes as uneven consequences and malevolent paternalism
                where “Technological innovation’s collateral damage means that the consequences of development are felt
                unevenly, the harms accruing to black and brown communities in the United States, and Indigenous, poor,
                and oppressed communities in the Latin American, South Asia, and Africa,” (Amrute, 2019). As much as
                Google’s restructuring is aimed at improving efficiency, there are still consequences that are unevenly
                distributed amongst those affected. In the case of this article, the employees from the original core
                team face job losses while their replacements in the Global South are employed under less favourable
                conditions. These dynamics highlight the existing inequalities between the regions. Furthermore, this
                narrative that Google has created jobs in developing countries only masks the exploitative nature of the
                company which I mentioned earlier. This paternalistic approach is seen as an act of benevolence, but it
                is a way of exploiting low-cost labour to maximize profits.
            </p>

            <p>
                Google is not the only company that can be accused of such actions, in fact, compared to trading goods
                corporations such as Puma and Walmart in a 2013 report it was estimated that 250 million child labourers
                between the ages of five and fourteen sew clothes for these respective companies and more. It is merely
                one of many that hide behind the good deed’s façade.
            </p>

            <p>
                But how does all this affect the South African software development industry you may ask? Well like many
                other global industries, our technology industry is very much intertwined with that of the rest of the
                world, especially with tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Meta. Like many of our other Global South
                counterparts, it is difficult for developers to enter a space that is so rooted in colonial tendencies
                and behaviours. Due to this increasingly of our local developers end up becoming outsourced labour, like
                what is happening in Google. For those who end up leaving the country, finding a job amid Google’s
                retrenchment and job relocations becomes difficult now that the competition has increased on a global
                scale. Even if one does land the job, chances are they will be exploited with lower wages and less job
                security compared to their Global North counterparts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Though the rate of worker retrenchments in South Africa is not so bad when compared to Google and other
                tech giants it is still a cause for concern. In a 2024 South African Report titled “State of the
                Software Developer Nation” by OFFERZEN, 5% of South African developers were retrenched in the past 12
                months. Based on the report, even though most of these developers were able to find jobs within the next
                3 months of their retrenchment, due to the fact they were senior developers, the junior developers
                experienced the heavier brunt of this with over 40% of them taking over 6 months to find a new job. Then
                it comes as a surprise when said juniors accept jobs from outside the country where they end up being
                exploited out of desperation for a better salary.
            </p>

            <p>
                With all this information, what can I as an aspiring web developer do in improving this industry and
                decolonizing it? The first thing is advocating for fair practice in the local companies. Amid frequent
                junior developer retrenchments, one thing myself and other young developers should do to become engaged
                in talks on equitable wages, better working conditions, and job security. That way, companies do not
                find it easy to exploit us. In addition to that, even within the workspace encouraging a team
                environment allows for bigger issues to be addressed with a larger voice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another way of playing a role in the decolonization effort is by promoting and creating local
                innovations. Supporting tech startups and initiatives that address the needs of the marginalized
                majority of South Africa will help us build a more resilient and independent tech industry. That way it
                fosters a sense of innovation and self-reliance where developers reduce reliance on global tech giants.
                In the same yearly report, it was shown that over half of South Africa’s local developers are working
                with an AI API. In addition to that, the majority are already working with code-writing assistants. The
                recent use of AI amongst developers as a working tool is a quick and efficient way to improve the
                quality of our local developers. Now I know this solution comes with a whole lot of negatives, but with
                proper administration and monitoring it could aim to help people.
            </p>

            <p>
                And lastly, learning ethical data use and labour practices is crucial. As mentioned before, big tech
                companies already have shown us that their tactics for tapping into unknown data regions are invasive to
                those at a technological disadvantage. One way this can be achieved is by teaching young developers like
                me design practices that promote transparency and accountability while also being in line with
                legislation laws that protect its users.
            </p>

            <p>
                The retrenchment of both local and global developers and the recent relocation of jobs to lower-cost
                regions highlights the deeply rooted colonial practices within the technology sector as outlined by
                Amrute. For us in South Africa and as developers, it is important to understand these dynamics so that
                we can plan for a future that promotes fair practice, and local innovation while ensuring ethical
                standards that work independently from global tech giants. By doing so, local developers can contribute
                to a more equitable industry.
