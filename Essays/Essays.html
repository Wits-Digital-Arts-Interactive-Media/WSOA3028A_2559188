            <h2>UI and UX Analysis of Adoozy Power Website</h2>

            <p>South Africa has over the years adopted the idea of having things ready at the earliest convenience
                whether it be food, clothing items or appliances. Online shopping websites allow users to purchase these
                items with easy accessibility and zero difficulty. And although that is what we as consumers expect from
                such websites, often we complain on how confusing it is to navigate around them. I have chosen to
                analyse the Adoozy power company website. In my analysis, I will be going over the UX and UI design of
                the Adoozy website, as well as the ethical implications of the site’s interaction design.</p>
            <p>Before I begin my analysis, let me begin by explaining who Adoozy Power are and what they do. Adoozy
                Power is a company that supplies power banks on the go. They set up stations in malls, events, and
                garages where people would need to charge their devices on the go and partner with varies companies to
                supply people with power whenever they may need it. (Their website link will be below).</p>
            <p>Now that the introductions are over, let me begin with the UI and UX analysis of the Adoozy website. I
                will begin by looking at the UX design of the website, which as explained by Peta Goldberg is “like the
                organs of a body for a website” (Goldberg 2024). The first thing I would like to look at is the ease of
                use of the website by examining the home and product pages.</p>

            <h3>Home Page</h3>
            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-06 193022.png" class="u-photo" alt="Adoozy Home Page" height="200px" ,
                width="350px">

            <p>Upon entering the Adoozy website, the user introduced with a navigation tab to the bottom left of the
                page, the company logo skilfully placed at the top right of the page, changing background images and
                text, ways of downloading their app and a navigation button at the top right of the page. All these
                elements appear evenly distributed, providing clear and visible means of navigation for potential
                user/clients.</p>

            <h3>Products/Power Page:</h3>
            <p>The images below are from the Adoozy Products/Power page. Like the homepage, the UI elements are visible,
                and users can easily distinguish them apart from each other. I like this page due to how easy they make
                it for users to know bout and use their products. They provide clear and well labelled steps on how to
                use their power banks, as well as easy to read descriptions and visuals on what they provide.</p>

            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-06 204519.png" class="u-photo" alt="Product Page" height="200px" ,
                width="350px">
            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-06 204820.png" class="u-photo" alt="Product Page" height="200px" ,
                width="350px">
            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-06 205842.png" class="u-photo" alt="Product Page" height="200px" ,
                width="350px">

            <p>In terms of providing convenience along with ease of use, the website does not do this well to an extent.
                There is more focus on promoting their product via their website instead of making their product more
                accessible using their website. Under the pricing heading, Adoozy provides two means of payment via
                Apple and Google Play. They could have improved on this by providing a delivery option via uber or any
                other local transport company, so customers do not have to leave their homes when in need of a power
                bank. The site does not allow room for personalization apart from payment methods, making it less
                accommodating for users with special needs.</p>
            <p>Due to the lack of diligence in terms of convenience and personalization, users of the Adoozy site who
                are challenged in some way would not be able to use the site effectively as it does not fully adhere to
                the WCAG’s (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. Reason being that the site itself does not
                provide things such as alternative text options for people with reading impairments or keyboard
                navigation features for disabled people.</p>
            <p>In terms of feedback mechanisms that the site provides, they do this well but there is still room for
                improvement. As seen with the first image below, the Adoozy team have provided a means of contacting
                them via leaving their contact details. Alternatively, one could call their landline number directly or
                email them.</p>

            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-07 135820.png" class="u-photo" alt="Product Page" height="200px" ,
                width="350px">

            <p>In addition to this, they provide a FAQ section to answer any questions users might have before making
                use of their power banks. I like this feature most because there is a level of transparency with users,
                which I will deliberate more on later in the essay.</p>

            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-07 205656.png" class="u-photo" alt="Adoozy FAQ" height="200px" ,
                width="350px">
            <p>One thing that the site developers could improve on is by adding a ratings and reviews system. Firstly,
                this makes it easy for potential clients to participate in helping their products improve through their
                website and secondly, it will encourage users to invest more time into scrolling through the website.
                Overall, the UX design of the site of Adoozy website is well designed. Though lacking in certain areas,
                the UX is user-centred and designed to invoke a level of trust in potential users of the site. One can
                tell from the homepage that though it is not too flashy, and that the Adoozy website developers made it
                with the intent of being user-friendly and aimed at driving customer focus on their products.</p>
            <p>Now that we have covered the UX of the website, let us look at its UI elements. As seen from the images
                provided from the pages of the site, there is evidence of good visual layout and navigation design. The
                images below are another example of how the site employs good visual design by providing clear and
                visually appealing images that match with the content of the website. In addition to that, said images
                and content are a linear in pattern that assists the user in navigating down the page creating a
                well-planned visual hierarchy.</p>

            <p>The navigation design of the website follows the law of locality as described in the lecture notes,
                “where elements are placed where users would expect them to be” (Goldberg 2024). As seen with the Adoozy
                homepage, though they have placed their navigation bar to bottom left, it is still within the same area
                where websites usually place them. This follows the First Law of locality in which the navigation bar is
                still within an area that will affect change, said area being anyone of the corner areas of the page.
                This unusual placing of the navigation bar also ties in with the Third Law which refers to how if an
                element is far from where it affects change, make it pop. If you go onto the site the homepage images
                change based on which heading is highlighted or underlined, upon noticing this change a user of the site
                would be encouraged to use the navigation bar. (I will highlight what I mean in the images of the
                homepage below).</p>

            <img src="../Images/Screenshot 2024-04-07 210353.png" class="u-photo" alt="Adoozy medai page" height="300px" ,
                width="450px">

            <p>Two more things to take note of regarding navigation is the navigation button and the use of the 3-Click
                Rule. The navigation button is in an area that effects change and offers an alternative and more
                familiar option for a user to find their way around the site. In addition to that, it stays within the
                3-Click Rule meaning everything is within three clicks to not lose the interest of current and potential
                users of the site.</p>
            <p>The website makes use of a readable and legible typography style. The font used is not too flashy and is
                readable. The sites responsive design needs improving. Though the developers have optimised the site for
                other devices, the layout of information becomes more compressed and slightly unreadable on a smart
                phone or tablet.
                Adoozy website has good UX and UI design but one thing that we must still observe is the ethical
                implications of said design choices. When designing a website, one must keep in mind that the aim is to
                enhance user satisfaction, while also not taking advantage of said user in the process.</p>

            <p>One way the Adoozy site does this is by not encroaching on their customers privacy. The site asks for
                limited contact details in the event one is looking to use or inquire about their products, ending the
                interaction at that. The website does not have any location tracking and is transparent in what you can
                and cannot do in relation to their products via the FAQ’s section. This ties well with the general user
                autonomy and control of the site as it empowers users by giving control over what they can do through
                the website.
                In relation to the site’s transparency, it highlights all payment and contact information using readable
                font, clear wording, and soft-shaped buttons. This ensures customers are not taken advantage of into
                agreeing to a payment plan they did not intend to sign up for.
            </p>

            <p>One thing though that is an issue with the site in terms of ethics is the lack of inclusivity. As I
                mentioned previously in my analysis of the site’s UX, though the site is easy to use for the average
                person. Having no features to personalize your experience such as font changing or images that include
                people such as the elderly or family set-ups removes that feeling of relatability from users.
                Vannevar Bush touches on this idea of inclusivity and relatability in his essay titled “As We May Think
                (1945),” that when he went about designing MEMEX, which is the precursor of the modern-day internet, he
                intended for it to link information based on meaningful connections rather than rigid hierarchical
                structures. Based on this definition, I believe though the Adoozy site aims to form a connection through
                their images, video, and news advertising, it still has a long way to go in terms of actively including
                all members of society into their client base.
            </p>

            <p>As far as I have seen, the website does not a plan towards term sustainability considering one of their
                most resent partners is Sasol. The power bank charging stations themselves rely on electricity produced
                by Eskom which relies solely on coal. If they wanted to improve on this, they could look at alternative
                means of producing power for their power banks in the future.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Adoozy Power website has a good base on their UI and UX design and the ethical use of them.
                Should they continue improving based on the feedback they receive from their customers, their website
                will be able to provide positive user experience and more inclusive web interactions.</p>
