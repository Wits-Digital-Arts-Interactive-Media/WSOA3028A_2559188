        <h2>WEEK 1</h2>

        <p>
            It's been only a week but I have realized there is much about the Web/internet that I did not know about. Last year I thought that I had a grasp of everything I needed to know concerning applications such as itch, GitHub and internet browsers like Opera GX, forgetting that I am not using them to their fullest capabilities nor do I understand down to their core.

            In regards to what we did in class this week and making our first web page, I will admit it was a bit daunting but also fun at the same time. I have used GitHub before only this time there were no hiccups (mainly because Unity wasn't involved). It was my first time using it in conjunction with Visual Studio Code, and although that was new for me I understood what was happening. 

            I chose to do 3 readings, "As We May think" by Vannevar Bush, the article associated with it by Simon Harper and "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. What I found interesting was how both Bush and Borges were in some way referring to the Web way before it was even made into what we know it as today. Bush focused on the physical application of it, while Borges was more on the theoretical and psychological aspect of it. What I observed from both of them is that they are writing about two parts of the Web/internet which make it what it is today. Bush describes Memex, a device that you can link your thoughts to and record all the knowledge you have, which sounds a lot like a cellphone or laptop. And Borges describes the amount of knowledge contained in an infinite library which resembles the information entered into the Web/internet.

            Both of their ideas make up the Web and how we interact with it. How we use our phones or other devices containing our personal information to access and share new information from an unlimited source of knowledge, similar to a library but much more than that. When I scroll through the internet I have an unlimited source of knowledge that is available to me at any time and I can use it as I see fit. Something I take for granted however is that in there being unlimited knowledge, I might not know when some of it is too much, which is something Borges touches on. Too much information from the internet can be bad if you overload yourself. 

            Based on all that I have learned this week, I aim to broaden my understanding of the web and learn to create meaningful and impactful websites inspired by Borges and Bush's way of thinking.

    <h2>WEEK 2</h2>
    
<p>
    <h3>Folder structure and URL scheme:</h3>
    My plan is to have a simple and concise folder structure. 
    Each folder will contain components I would need for my website such as images, css style sheets, javascript scripts, blogpost resources and font styles.
    As I continue building my website, I plan on refining this structure and changing it as I go. 
    In terms of my URL scheme, I plan on making a user friendly, semantic URL scheme that it is easily readable to users and informs the user where they are and what paths are accessible to them on my website. 
    I am still undecided on whether to make it a local (.co.za) OR international domain (.com). Here are a few examples I made (note none of them lead anywhere, hopefully):

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://warizzi-verse.com/homepage/blogs/essaysLinks">https://warizzi-verse.com/homepage/blogs/essays</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://warizzi-verse.comLinks">https://warizzi-verse.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://waronalouw-warizzi.co.zaLinks">https://waronalouw-warizzi.co.za</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://warizzi-verse.co.za/homepageLinks">https://warizzi-verse.co.za/homepage</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <h3>Wireframes:</h3>

    <img src= "Images/Wireframe1.png" alt= "A picture of Wireframe1" height= "200px", width="400px" >
    <img src= "Images/Wireframe2.png" alt= "A picture of Wireframe2" height= "200px", width="400px" >
    <img src= "Images/Wireframe3.png" alt= "A picture of Wireframe3" height= "200px", width="400px" >
    <img src= "Images/Wireframe4.png" alt= "A picture of Wireframe4" height= "400px", width="200px" >

    What I am aiming at in my wireframes is a user friendly design for PC and cellphone users. 
    I did not want to make a single page to complicated on any device, each page will have a similar design, an image associated with the page, the page content, a crossbar or index image leading to different pages on the website and the title of the page in a readable and alluring font.

    <h3>Inspirations and links:</h3>

    These are some of the websites I plan on drawing inspiration from. 
    They have a general user friendly structure that I would like to implement.

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://animesuge.toLinks to an external site.">https://animesuge.to</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://bbdsoftware.comLinks to an external site.">https://bbdsoftware.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://speakgeek.co.zaLinks to an external site.">https://speakgeek.co.za</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://agoradigital.art/what-is-data-art/#:~:text=Data%20art%20is%20a%20form,graph%2C%20chart%2C%20or%20animationLinks to an external site.">https://agoradigital.art/what-is-data-art/#:~:text=Data%20art%20is%20a%20form,graph%2C%20chart%2C%20or%20animation</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <h3>Reading Reflection:</h3>

What I understood from the reading, based on the relation of hypertext and McLuhan's Laws of Media, is that the internet has been a place where ideas and concepts have been recycled, rediscovered and reinvented.
Rarely has there been something revolutionary added to it. The internet today relies on hypertext, interconnected nodes of information which we as users can interact with. 
The way we interact with that information is different to the linear structure of reading information from books, allowing us to interact with things all at once instead of one at a time. Hypertext enhances how we interact with the internet by presenting us with multiple streams of information which can be accessed at anytime while making more conventional modes of linear media obsolete due to how accessible everything is now. 
With it being able to access everything, older concepts similar to Memex or Xanadu are easily retrievable and can be augmented into the internet, pushing it to its limits and creating new modes of expression and understanding.

<h3>What does interaction mean to me?</h3>

What interaction means to me is that for something to be interactable it must first be made human-friendly, meaning a random person will be able to learn and be able to use something new with ease and understanding. 
In the context of the WWW, a website or page should be easy to navigate and not confuse the user of the site. 
As a web designer, whatever I make must be human-centered, and not difficult to understand.
