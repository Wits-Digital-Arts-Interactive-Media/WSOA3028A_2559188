    <h2>WEEK 1</h2>

    <p>
        It's been only a week but I have realized there is much about the Web/internet that I did not know about. Last year I thought that I had a grasp of everything I needed to know concerning applications such as itch, GitHub and internet browsers like Opera GX, forgetting that I am not using them to their fullest capabilities nor do I understand down to their core.

        In regards to what we did in class this week and making our first web page, I will admit it was a bit daunting but also fun at the same time. I have used GitHub before only this time there were no hiccups (mainly because Unity wasn't involved). It was my first time using it in conjunction with Visual Studio Code, and although that was new for me I understood what was happening. 

        I chose to do 3 readings, "As We May think" by Vannevar Bush, the article associated with it by Simon Harper and "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. What I found interesting was how both Bush and Borges were in some way referring to the Web way before it was even made into what we know it as today. Bush focused on the physical application of it, while Borges was more on the theoretical and psychological aspect of it. What I observed from both of them is that they are writing about two parts of the Web/internet which make it what it is today. Bush describes Memex, a device that you can link your thoughts to and record all the knowledge you have, which sounds a lot like a cellphone or laptop. And Borges describes the amount of knowledge contained in an infinite library which resembles the information entered into the Web/internet.

        Both of their ideas make up the Web and how we interact with it. How we use our phones or other devices containing our personal information to access and share new information from an unlimited source of knowledge, similar to a library but much more than that. When I scroll through the internet I have an unlimited source of knowledge that is available to me at any time and I can use it as I see fit. Something I take for granted however is that in there being unlimited knowledge, I might not know when some of it is too much, which is something Borges touches on. Too much information from the internet can be bad if you overload yourself. 

        Based on all that I have learned this week, I aim to broaden my understanding of the web and learn to create meaningful and impactful websites inspired by Borges and Bush's way of thinking.
