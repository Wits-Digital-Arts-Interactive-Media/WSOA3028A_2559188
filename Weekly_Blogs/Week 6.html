            <ul>
                <li> Text: The text of the website is leagible and easy to read. Font colour changes when hovering
                    around buttons to keep it readable.</li>
                <li> Buttons: They have a hover feature on the buttons that lets the user know that their mouse is on
                    the button. They also blend well with the rest of the page.</li>
                <li> Interactive images: The product images highlight themselves around the border to indicate what the
                    user is interested in.</li>
                <li> Cookies: Does not request for cookies, user information and data remain confidential.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> Visual Graphics: The red, white, and blue colours do not blend so well. They are all bright and
                    make it a bit difficult to read stuff. </li>
                <li> Semantic Markup: From what I could tell from the inspector, the site makes use of many div
                    containers. Though they help in making things flow, too much content can confuse the user.</li>

                <li> Load screens: The site has a loading screen which informs the user whether or not the site is

                    their mouse over them.</li>

                <li> Usability and scalibility: Can be used on other devices like a cell phone, but loses it's proper
                    layout making things squished on the screen.</li>
                <li> Other than that there is nothing really bad about this site that I have scanned.</li>
