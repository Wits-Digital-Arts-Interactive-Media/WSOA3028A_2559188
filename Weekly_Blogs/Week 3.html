            <h2>WEEK 3</h2>


            <p>
            <h3>User alignment:</h3> The goal for my website is to make it as user friendly as possible. I aim to make
            it
            easy to navigate and understand for the user, so they are able to view my pages such as my portfolio work
            without having to click onto countless links. When users enter my website the goal is to design it in such a
            way
            that they are not overwhelmed by what they see so that they are to digest what is in front of them and be
            able
            to view whatever they may be looking for using the 3-Click Rule. As for who the target audience of my
            website
            will be, as for specifics, anyone who can use a piece of technology to access my site. Hence my desire to
            make
            it as user friendly as possible, having a catchy yet not too overwhelming layout that will encourage people
            to
            look at my work.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection on structure and URL scheme:</h3>
            <p>
                Based on what I have mentioned so far, my sites navigation structure will depend on the filing structure
                that I had drawn up in previous discussions. That means ensuring I give all my sites content the
                appropriate
                naming conventions as well as there being buttons or a navigation bar that can be accessed on any page
                of my
                website, should the user need to navigate somewhere else quickly on my page. My URL scheme will reflect
                this
                navigation by making the user aware what paths they are currently on on my website. I believe this will
                help
                keep things consistent and usable in the long run.
                In relation to semantic markup, in order for my site to communicate clearly with my target audience I
                need
                to use the appropriate HTML tags that will make it easy for myself to structure my website how I want as
                well as maintaining consistency with my audience.
            </p>

            <h3>Development process for the week:</h3>
            <p>In terms of my development progress this week, I have been moving at a steady pace insuring that I am
                applying all that I have learnt so far. My goal at the moment is learning which elements are appropriate
                to
                use to make my site easier to navigate. My main focus is to ensure it is structured well before we begin
                learning to make it look pretty. That means using the concepts surrounding semantic markup</p>
