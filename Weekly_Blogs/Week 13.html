            <h3>WEEK 13: Reflecting on the Internet as an ethical space</h3>

            <p>What does this mean to me? To answer this question, I would first need to break down what ethics are. In
                a broad definition, ethics are what justifies our moral judgments, determining what is morally right
                from wrong. Ethics, especially on the internet, reflect our behavior and as a result, can be programmed
                into the internet. Ideally, for myself at least, I would like to think the internet is not so ethical.
                The reason is that though it is built to serve everyone, at its core it is meant to be used by a
                specific group of people, particularly those of Western/European descent. This bias in the structure of
                the internet firstly makes minimal effort to include minority groups and even when the effort is made,
                it only caters to the smallest of parameters of change. Though over recent years there have been some
                improvements, there is little effort put into making it friendly for minority users.</p>

            <p>What would this look like? Firstly, transparency with users and how their data is being used. When
                building a website or web application, being transparent with data collection should be at the
                forefront, that way companies are held accountable for their actions. Second is privacy, respecting the
                rights of people and how much personal information should be asked to ensure the safety of the user.
                This should involve implementing strong security and guidelines that protect people and promote respect
                in the digital community. Lastly inclusivity, by involving members of minority groups in the process of
                designing and coding so that it may be better relevant to those using it by practicing semantic HTML and
                responsive design. </p>

            <p>Challenges in Achieving an Ethical Internet Space? The first challenge in achieving an ethical internet
                space is firstly bridging the digital divide. Closing the gap between those who are with and those who
                are without access to internet networks and technology. This would involve addressing infrastructure
                issues and social injustices within rural and underserved areas. Another challenge would be balancing
                global standards with local norms and regulations, what can be considered ethical in one culture or
                region may not be in another. The next challenge would be the enforcement of regulations across many
                regions, considering everyone has different laws surrounding the internet and its use. The last and
                probably biggest challenge is corporate cooperation, companies driven by profit goals may prioritize
                user engagement and data collection over ethical practices, leading to a perpetuation of already
                existing harmful data patterns.</p>
