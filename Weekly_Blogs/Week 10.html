            <h3>WEEK 10: Digital Inequalities</h3>

            <p>In their 2015 article, Robinson et al. delve into the intricate realm of digital inequalities, shedding
                light on why these discrepancies matter in our increasingly digitalized world. The authors explore a
                vivid image of the digital divide, illustrating how disparities in access, skills, and usage of digital
                technologies persist across various socio-economic backgrounds. This divide is not merely about owning
                the latest gadgets; rather, it encompasses a multifaceted spectrum of disparities that influence one's
                engagement with the digital realm.</p>

            <p>One key insight highlighted by Robinson et al. is the intertwined nature of digital inequalities with
                broader societal issues, such as education, employment, and social inclusion. We need to recognize the
                profound impact of digital proficiency on academic success and future career prospects. In places like
                South Africa, or Africa as a whole, there are massive disparities in technology between the rich and
                poor, affecting digital profiency on academic success and future career prospects. Those lacking access
                to digital resources or proficient digital skills face significant barriers in accessing educational
                materials, job opportunities, and social networks, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage.</p>

            <p>In class this week, one of the topics we had on this was how it is difficult for women to enter the tech
                industry today. During this class, I brought up a point I got from a related reading that explains the
                reason for this difficulty. The reading covers how race, gender and disability have an effect on how you
                are treated in the tech industry. How if one does not fit into the "white, hetero-sexual image" that is
                commonly seen in this industry then they won't get the same recognition or respect as their white male
                counterparts. This reading was blunt in how it addresses this issue, highlighting factors that
                influence these inequlities.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Robinson et al. shed light on the ramifications of digital inequalities for democracy and
                civic engagement. In an era where social media platforms serve as battlegrounds for shaping public
                discourse, the unequal distribution of digital resources amplifies voices of privilege while silencing
                marginalized communities. This not only undermines the principles of democratic participation but also
                exacerbates existing power differentials within society.</p>
