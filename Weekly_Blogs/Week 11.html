            <h3>WEEK 11: Blog prospects</h3>

            <h4>What changes have you had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript?</h4>

            <p>Trying to decide where and how to implement JavaScript into my website posed a challenge. Before
                incorporating anything, I returned to my previous posts to remind myself what experience I aimed to
                create for my users. When incorporating JavaScript into my site, the aim was to incorporate as many
                interactive elements as possible. What I mean is giving interactive and meaningful feedback as well as
                easy navigation.
                The first area in which I incorporated JavaScript was the navigation bar. This was challenging to do due
                to having to implement it on every page of my website. I had to re-evaluate and then re-do most of my
                folder structure since the file paths were muddled up causing some of my pages to go blank. Once I found
                the solution to that, I began incorporating it into the rest of my pages. I also had to delete some of
                the HTML navigation bars because they were interfering and making things untidy.
            </p>

            <p>This process with the navigation bar made me realize that I should always code my HTML while keeping
                JavaScript additions in mind. This became evident to me when I began manipulating some of my page
                headings to pop up in bold capital letters with a mouse hover event, to accommodate users who would like
                to read more visible letters. I aimed to apply a similar principle to some of the images in my design
                and essay pages but unfortunately could not get to it. It is something that I still aim to incorporate
                into my website.</p>

            <h4>How does that help you streamline your interaction design?</h4>

            <p>These changes that I have made to my website help me streamline my IxD via my navigation and information
                components. As mentioned, my website intends to be as interactive and user-friendly as possible. This
                means adding things like buttons and pop-ups The incorporation of JavaScript makes my ideas possible,
                but I still need to do more research and practice in that regard. </p>

            <h4>Digital Coloniality: Birhane (2020) - Algorithmic Colonization of Africa</h4>

            <p>I found this reading quite relevant to the current digital/media climate of today. Birhane brings up some
                compelling and interesting ideas of digital imperialism, mainly how prevalent it has become especially
                in places that were once colonies, and the parallels between traditional and algorithmic colonialism.
                What stood out for me was how traditional colonialism has somewhat evolved into a more algorithmic-based
                form of conquest. Where one relied on physical and political means of exerting power and control, the
                other operated behind less visible and masked ways of gaining control of the digital landscape. This
                shift now aims to exploit the most vulnerable who are now present within the digital landscape such as
                the internet/web and social media.
            </p>

            <p>Birhane dives deeper into these ideas by bringing to light how technology companies make up these tactics
                of algorithmic control. This highlights the motivations of these companies in how they aim to maintain
                dominance by introducing irrelevant technological innovations that do not aim to help nor are made to
                help previously marginalized groups of people. All through wealth accumulation and market control, while
                being pervasive and often invisible. </p>

            <p>How does this affect African Development? Well, Western-developed AI has become very profound in everyday
                use in Africa. Companies that develop such technologies venture into Africa with the message that they
                aim to help the African population connect to the rest of the world, often masking the fact they are
                using the people of Africa to exploit and farm their data. As a result, this tends to hinder local
                innovations and start-ups from gaining traction in the market, leading foreign solutions to be ignorant
                of the actual needs of indigenous peoples making their help irrelevant. All this further highlights the
                historical experiences of the African continent, a history soaked in foreign intervention bringing more
                harm than good. This further leads to a perpetuation of such actions by the same powers.</p>

            <p>The reading does offer some valid solutions to this problem, but some in my opinion are easier said than
                done considering we would need to play by the same rules that oppress us to create some change. One way
                is by investing in more of our local innovations, decreasing the need for foreign intervention by
                Western powers, and increasing the use of more indigenous-driven solutions. Another more effective way
                is scrutinizing imported technologies by creating regulations that ensure foreign intervention aligns
                with local needs.</p>

            <p>This reading though not as dense as some of the other readings I have done offers great insight into ways
                of decolonizing technology.</p>
