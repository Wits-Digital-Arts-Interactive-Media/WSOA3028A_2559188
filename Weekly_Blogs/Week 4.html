            <h2>WEEK 4</h2>

            <h3>Goal Alignment:</h3>
            <p>
                My Goal: To make a website that is user friendly, whose interface incites interest amongst it's users. I
                want my website to showcase my portfolio from throughout the semester while also giving them insight
                into who I am as a creative.
                <br>
                The User: The user should be able to find their way seamlessly through my website, whether they are
                taking a look at my portfolio work or just browsing.
                <br>
                My Content: My animation assignments done in Blender, my website code and/or planning and essays I have
                written throughout the semester so far.
                <br>
            </p>

            <img src="../Images/User flow.png" class="u-photo" alt="User Flow image" height="400px" , width="500px">

            <h3>Interface Elements:</h3>
            <p>
                Input Controls: Buttons with a short description, leading to further information like a blog post for a
                specific week.
                <br>
                Navigation Components: A navigation bar will be present on each page, allowing users easy access through
                my website.
                <br>
                Information Components: I will possibly use icons as well as tooltips.
                <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this process:</h3>
            <p>
                My wireframes are still okay at the moment. As I contiune sifting the web for inspiartion I will add
                more to them or change them entirely. At the moment I am still trying to find more effecient
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection on my Website:</h3>

            <p>The making of this website was not as daunting as I thought it would be. It was my first time learning
                HTML, but I found it a lot easier to grasp compared to when I learned C# last year. The MDN developer
                page really helped in grasping the theory and using it in a practical way. Semantics are one thing I
                still need to make a habit of using within my website.</p>
            <p>I am proud that I slowly managed to bring most of the ideas for my website to life. I am proud that I
                have memorized and practiced most of the essential elements and semantics of the HTML language. The
                basics are slowly becoming second nature to me and I am glad that I have put in the effort.</p>
            <p>Going forward, I would like to change my process when designing my website. Though I have made some
                progress, I believe there is still more I need to learn in terms of the overall look and feel of my
                website. All of this will come with more learning.</p>
