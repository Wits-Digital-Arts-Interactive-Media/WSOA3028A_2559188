            <h3>Week 12: The Internet as an Ethical Space</h3>

            <h4>How your CSS relates to the HTML and JS</h4>

            <p>
                When incorporating CSS into my website, I have kept in mind that it should work closely with my HTML and
                JavaScript in creating a cohesive and dynamic user experience. Where my HTML provides structure to my
                web content, CSS enhances this structure by applying colors, readable font, and a user-friendly layout
                that is visually appealing and accessible. Most of it is minimal for now regarding how CSS relates to my
                JavaScript code. My focus now is
                maintaining a separation between the three (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) to improve my code, my website's
                performance, and its overall accessibility. As I continue working on my website, I will hopefully be
                able to make them co-exist with no issues.</p>

            <h4>The Benefits and Challenges of Responsive Design</h4>

            <p>One benefit that is first and foremost on my list in developing my website is improved user experience.
                This means ensuring that my website provides an optimal experience across all platforms, where a user
                can access the site via phone, tablet, or desktop. I would like my efforts at responsive design to
                increase my website visibility. One challenge I have encountered so far is the complexity of
                implementation, developing a site that is
                responsive and incorporates CSS. Since incorporating my CSS into my website, I have been making attempts
                to prevent my images or navigation bars from overflowing out of the screen. This is still a bit of a
                challenge but I am working through it through trial an error by research the use of grids and flexbox.
            </p>

            <h4>My Coding practices concerning decolonialism</h4>

            <p>As I have mentioned previously, my goal for my website is to make it as inclusive, and user-friendly as
                possible. This means being aware of certain cultural contexts when designing interfaces, creating code
                that is easy to adapt to other languages, as well as making my site respect its user's data and privacy.
                In short, this involves avoiding assumptions in my design process, continuously learning so that my site
                is more accessible, and reaching out to communities for feedback on how I can improve my website.</p>
