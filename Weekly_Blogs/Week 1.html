            <h2>WEEK 1</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>It's been only a week but I have realized there is much about the Web/internet that I did not know about.
                Last year I thought that I had a grasp of everything I needed to know concerning applications such as
                itch,
                GitHub and internet browsers like Opera GX, forgetting that I am not using them to their fullest
                capabilities nor do I understand down to their core.</p>

            <p>In regards to what we did in class this week and making our first web page, I will admit it was a bit
                daunting but also fun at the same time. I have used GitHub before only this time there were no hiccups
                (mainly because Unity wasn't involved). It was my first time using it in conjunction with Visual Studio
                Code, and although that was new for me I understood what was happening.</p>

            <p>I chose to do 3 readings, "As We May think" by Vannevar Bush, the article associated with it by Simon
                Harper
                and "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. What I found interesting was how both Bush and Borges
                were
                in some way referring to the Web way before it was even made into what we know it as today. Bush focused
                on
                the physical application of it, while Borges was more on the theoretical and psychological aspect of it.
                What I observed from both of them is that they are writing about two parts of the Web/internet which
                make it
                what it is today. Bush describes Memex, a device that you can link your thoughts to and record all the
                knowledge you have, which sounds a lot like a cellphone or laptop. And Borges describes the amount of
                knowledge contained in an infinite library which resembles the information entered into the
                Web/internet.
            </p>

            <p>Both of their ideas make up the Web and how we interact with it. How we use our phones or other devices
                containing our personal information to access and share new information from an unlimited source of
                knowledge, similar to a library but much more than that. When I scroll through the internet I have an
                unlimited source of knowledge that is available to me at any time and I can use it as I see fit.
                Something I
                take for granted however is that in there being unlimited knowledge, I might not know when some of it is
                too
                much, which is something Borges touches on. Too much information from the internet can be bad if you
                overload yourself.</p>

            <p>Based on all that I have learned this week, I aim to broaden my understanding of the web and learn to
                create
                meaningful and impactful websites inspired by Borges and Bush's way of thinking.</p>
