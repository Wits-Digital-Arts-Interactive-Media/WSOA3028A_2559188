            <h2>WEEK 2</h2>

            <h3>Folder structure and URL scheme:</h3>

            <p>My plan is to have a simple and concise folder structure. Each folder will contain components I would
                need
                for my website such as images, links to other sites, my blog and essay posts. As I continue building my
                website, I plan on refining this structure and changing it as I go. In terms of my URL scheme, I plan on
                making a user friendly, semantic URL scheme that it is easily readable to users and one that informs the
                user where they are and what paths are accessible to them on my website. I am still undecided on whether
                to
                make it a local (.co.za) OR international domain (.com). Here are a few examples I made (note none of
                them
                lead anywhere, hopefully):</p>

                width="400px">
            <img src="../Images/Wireframe2.png" class="u-photo" alt="Second Wireframe image" height="200px" ,

                width="400px">

            <p> What I am aiming at in my wireframes is a user friendly design for PC and cellphone users. I did not
                want to
                make a single page to complicated on any device, each page will have a similar design, an image
                associated
                with the page, the page content, a crossbar or index image leading to different pages on the website and
                the
                title of the page in a readable and alluring font. Here are some links I attached where I drew
                inspiration
                from.</p>

            <h3>Reading Reflection:</h3>
            <p>
                What I understood from the reading, based on the relation of hypertext and McLuhan's Laws of Media, is
                that
                the internet has been a place where ideas and concepts have been recycled, rediscovered and reinvented.
                Rarely has there been something revolutionary added to it. The internet today relies on hypertext,
                interconnected nodes of information which we as users can interact with. The way we interact with that
                information is different to the linear structure of reading information from books, allowing us to
                interact
                with things all at once instead of one at a time. Hypertext enhances how we interact with the internet
                by
                presenting us with multiple streams of information which can be accessed at anytime while making more
                conventional modes of linear media obsolete due to how accessible everything is now. With it being able
                to
                access everything, older concepts similar to Memex or Xanadu are easily retrievable and can be augmented
                into the internet, pushing it to its limits and creating new modes of expression and understanding.
            </p>

            <h3>What does interaction mean to me?</h3>
            <p>
                What interaction means to me is that for something to be interactable it must first be made
                human-friendly,
                meaning a random person will be able to learn and be able to use something new with ease and
                understanding.
                In the context of the WWW, a website or page should be easy to navigate and not confuse the user of the
                site. As a designer, whatever I make must be human-centered, and not difficult to understand.
            </p>
